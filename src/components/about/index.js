                <p>Hi. My name is Micha≈Ç and I live in Lublin. I started learn programming in high school. First language which I learned was object pascal (Delphi). It was very popular at this time. My secong language was PHP. Unfortunately, PHP (without frameworks) not suitable for biggest projects. So I learned Code Igniter and then Laravel.</p>
