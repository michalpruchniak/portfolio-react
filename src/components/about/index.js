                <p>Hi. My name is Micha≈Ç and I live in Lublin. Currently, I work in police like IT specialist. Even though I like my job, I see my future in programming. I started learn programming in high school. First language which I learned was object pascal (Delphi). It was very popular at this time. My second language was PHP. Unfortunately, PHP (without frameworks) not suitable for biggest projects. So I learned Code Igniter and then Laravel. I started learn JS in order to create microinteractions but the possibilities of js are enormous. Today I focus on frontend. My first JS framework is React and I try get to know ecosystem of React.</p>
